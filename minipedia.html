   <p><h2><b>The 2024 Wayanad landslides </b>were a series of landslides that occurred in<u style="color:blue;"> Punjirimattom, Mundakkai, Chooralmala, and Vellarimala villages in Meppadi panchayat, Vythiri taluk[5] in Wayanad district, Kerala</u>, India in the early hours of 30 July  2024. The landslides were caused by heavy rains that caused hillsides to collapse onto the areas below. The disaster was one of the deadliest in Kerala's history, with reports of 254 fatalities,[6][7] 397 injuries,[8] and 118 people missing.<u style="color:blue;">[7][8] Deforestation,</u> seismic sensitivity, poor building construction, and<u style="color:blue;"> global warming </u>have been identified as possible causes for the landslides and fatalities.</h2></p>
   <br>
   <p><h2>Many government agencies such as the armed forces, the<u style="color:blue"> National Disaster Response Force </u>(NDRF), fire and rescue services, and <u style="color:blue">forest and wildlife </u>, as well as volunteers, launched a large-scale rescue mission to search for survivors.[9]</h2></p>

<p> <h2>The Western Ghats in Kerala experienced heavy rains, accumulating 204.5 mm (8.05 in) of rainfall during the first 24 hours and 372.6 mm (14.67 in) in the following 24 hours before the event.[22] Due to the heavy rainfall, residents of Punjirimattom, Attamala, and Mundakkai were relocated to relief camps by local authorities starting on 29 July 2024. Despite an alert issued by the district administration, many residents in the Chooralmala area chose to remain in their homes, as the area was not classified as landslide-prone.[23][24] Around 02:17 IST (20:47 UTC),[25] a landslide struck near the origin of the Punnappuzha river (one of the tributaries of Chaliyar), between the villages of Punjirimattom and Mundakkai, sweeping away both villages.[26][27] This was followed by a second landslide at approximately 04:10 IST (22:40 UTC) in nearby Chooralmala, which diverted the Iruvanjippuzha river, causing flash floods that washed away the entire Chooralmala village. The collapse of the only bridge connecting the settlements left approximately 400 families stranded in Mundakkai and Attamala.[27]</h2></p>
<p><h3>The villages of Punjirimattom, Mundakkai, Chooralmala, and Vellarimala are located on hilly terrain and farmland used for tea and coffee plantations, such as <u style="color:blue;">Harrisons Malayalam Limited.</u> They border the<u style="color:blue;"> Nilambur forests </u> the <u style="color:blue;">Chaliyar</u> river. Residents of these villages are primarily agricultural workers who have lived in the area for generations. Most of the residents are plantation workers and raise animals.[21]</h3></p>

<p><h3>According to the <u style="color:blue;">First Information Report </u>(FIR) on the <u style="color:blue;">Wayanad landslides</u> prepared by the <u style="color:blue;">Geological Survey of India</u>, the velocity of the debris flow was 57 m/s (190 ft/s). The debris flow originated as a debris slide at an elevation of 1,544 metres (5,066 ft), then followed the river's path, carrying tons of rock and soil mixed with water, forming a slurry that devastated everything in its path.[28] The<u style="color:blue;"> National Remote Sensing Centre</u> (NRSC), a subsidiary of the <u style="color:blue;">Indian Space Research Organisation</u>, analyzed satellite imagery and released their findings on 1 August 2024. The images revealed that approximately 86,000 m2 (930,000 sq ft) of land had moved down the hill.[29]</h3></p>

<p><h3>Four helicopters, as well as a C-130 cargo plane and numerous <u style="color:blue;">drone</u> aircraft were deployed by Indian Air Force for rescue operation.[111][51] Fourteen Army columns, along with five medical teams, the Madras Engineer Group, two teams from the Defence Security Corps, a parachute regiment team, and 15 dogs from a K-9 dog squad were mobilized by the Indian Army.[111] Other specialized equipment such as radar and excavators were also deployed by the Army.[112] The INS Zamorin was sent to the area to assist with rescue operations.[113] An Indian Navy column from Kozhikode, a medical team, a river crossing team, and two sets of UAV-based sub-soil scanners were deployed for rescue and relief operation.[114] The Indian Coast Guard provided three disaster response teams (two from Kochi and one from Beypore), along with ALH MK III aircraft stationed at Kochi, CGS Kochi, ICGS Beypore and CGS Vizhinjam.[111] Other disaster response forces included four teams from the NDRF, the SDRF, the Forest Department, the Fire Service, and the Kerala police. The Wayanad district administration and Civil Defence mobilized 100 ambulances, doctors, medical supplies, and equipment.[115]</h3></p>
<center><h1><u>Causes</u></h1>
   <img src="C:\Users\Lokesh\OneDrive\Pictures\CAUSES.jpg">
<h1><u>Deforestation</u></h1></center>
<p><h3>The<u style="color:blue;">Cochin University of Science and Technology</u> in Kochi conducted a study on soil <u style="color:blue;">topography</u> and <u style="color:blue;">geomorphology</u> of Wayanad and concluded that major <u style="color:blue;">deforestation</u> occurred in Wayanad district as a result of the creation of<u style="color:blue;"> tea plantations</u>, which contributed to the landslides.[127][128]</h3></p>
<br>
<p><h3>Another study published in 2022 by the<u style="color:blue;"> International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</u> on deforestation in Wayanad district showed that 62% of green cover in the district disappeared between 1950 and 2018, while tea plantation cover rose by around 1800%, leaving less forest to keep muddy hills stable.[129] <u style="color:blue;">Kerala's</u> hilly regions have slopes of more than 20 degrees, increasing the risk of flash floods during heavy rains.</h3></p>
